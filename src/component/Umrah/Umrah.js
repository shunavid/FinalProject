          editorial team to ensure that the content is up to date & accurate. As
          is well-known, the Hajj pilgrimage is one of the five pillars of
          Islam. Prior to the pandemic, millions of Muslims travel to Mecca from
          around the world to visit the Great Mosque of Mecca (Masjid al Haram)
          and perform various religious rituals and devotion. However, in
          addition to this Ibāda (act of worship), there is also the Umrah or
          the “minor Hajj,” which similarly necessitates Muslims to make their
          way to the Holy City and complete a set of rituals.

          Since there’s a possibility of Saudi Arabia reopening their borders to
          pilgrims this year, let us learn more about the lesser-known Umrah
          pilgrimage for the year 2021.{" "}
        </p>
        <h3>What is Umrah?</h3>
        <p>
          Umrah literally translates to ‘visiting a populated place,’ but what
          Muslims essentially do is visiting the Holy Kaaba and seizing the
          opportunity to become closer to Allah and renew their faith. <br />{" "}
          Any Muslim who is able to successfully complete the pilgrimage is
          considered a guest of Allah Himself and is thus granted forgiveness
          and answered prayers.
        </p>
        <h3>How does Umrah differ from Hajj?</h3>
        <div className="umrah-second"></div>
        <br />
        <p>
          The main difference between Umrah and Hajj lies in the nature of the
          respective journeys. The Hajj is compulsory for all able-bodied
          Muslims with the financial means of doing so during the Hajj season.
          Umrah, on the other hand, is voluntary in nature and can be undertaken
          at any time of the year outside the Hajj season.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Hajj is also a more extensive and comprehensive worship experience
          lasting for five days as opposed to the Umrah which can be completed
          in a matter of hours. As such, the cost of performing the Hajj is
          astronomically higher than that of Umrah and requires pilgrims to be
          physically and mentally prepared for the journey.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, both the major and minor journeys are centered on the Kaabah
          sitting at the center of the Masjid al Haram; the sacred structure
          where Muslims all around the world direct their five daily prayers to.
        </p>
        <h3>What are the rituals of Umrah?</h3>
        <p>
          Compared to the Hajj, the rituals of Umrah are significantly shorter
          and simpler. The following are the essential rituals performed in
          Umrah:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Enter into a state of Ihram (purity and devotion). Thoroughly wash
            and clean your body and wear the appropriate garments.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Recite the Talbiyah in the miqat station and declare your niyat to
            perform the Umrah.
          </li>
          <li>Make your way to Mecca.</li>
          <li>
            Enter the Masjid Al Haram and perform the tawaf – circling the Kaaba
            seven times in a counterclockwise direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Perform the Sa’ay – walking 7 times between the hills of Safa and
            Marwah adjacent to the the Kaaba.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, exit the state of Ihram by shaving your head (taqseer). For
            women, the state of Ihram is completed by cutting off a short lock
            of hair.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When is Umrah 2021?</h3>
        <p>
          Umrah can be performed any time of the year, but it’s highly
          recommended to do so during Ramadan. This year’s Ramadan falls on 12
          or 13 April 2021 in many places around the world.
        </p>
        <h3>Umrah 2021 guidelines and vaccine requirement</h3>
        <p>
          The Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has stated that the kingdom will
          only allow pilgrims who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or have
          recovered from coronavirus to embark on the pilgrimage into the Masjid
          al Haram in Mecca and the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina. An individual’s
          vaccination status will first need to be registered on Saudi Arabia’s
          COVID-19 app, Tawakkalna and the Umrah app Eatmarna. The Tawakkalna
          and Eatmarna apps are the only official portals authorized to issue
          genuine permits, and the authorities have warned the public to avoid
          shady websites and filling out bogus forms.
